## Notes
- The mobile version horizontal product card is used since it was discussed in class, which would tecnically count as a design meeting.

- It is very likely that I will not be able to finish this for the 10th, however, it WILL be done by Friday the 13th. This semester has been hectic and I have not been able to work on this as much as I would have liked.
